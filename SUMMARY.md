# SWallet - Substrate Wallet Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

SWallet is a cryptocurrency wallet implementation designed for Substrate-based blockchains like Polkadot, Kusama, and other Substrate networks. The project has been built with two components:

1. A full Rust implementation using the Substrate SDK
2. A PowerShell demo that simulates the wallet's functionality

## Implementation Details

### Rust Implementation (Ready for when Rust is installed)

The Rust implementation consists of:

- **src/main.rs**: Command-line interface with commands for creating, importing wallets and making transactions
- **src/wallet.rs**: Core wallet functionality (key generation, signing, etc.)
- **src/rpc.rs**: Connectivity to Substrate nodes for on-chain operations
- **src/utils.rs**: Helper functions for address formatting and validation

Key Features:
- Create and manage wallet accounts with mnemonics
- Import existing wallets from seed phrases
- Check account balances on any Substrate network
- Transfer funds between accounts
- Advanced cryptography with sr25519 support

### PowerShell Demo (Successfully Demonstrated)

Since Rust wasn't available on the system, we created a PowerShell demo that simulates the key functionality:

1. **Wallet Creation**: Generated a simulated Substrate address and mnemonic
2. **Account Management**: Stored and retrieved wallet information from a JSON file
3. **Balance Checking**: Simulated connecting to a Substrate node and retrieving balance
4. **Fund Transfers**: Demonstrated the transfer process including:
   - Recipient selection
   - Amount entry
   - Transaction submission
   - Balance updates

## Demo Results

The demo successfully:
- Created a wallet with address `15oF4uVJwmoWERIvgTroi`
- Generated a mnemonic phrase
- Simulated an initial balance of 10 DOT
- Executed a transfer of 2.5 DOT
- Updated the balance to 7.5 DOT
- Generated a transaction hash

## Next Steps

To implement the full functionality:

1. Install Rust and Cargo
2. Run `cargo build` to compile the Rust implementation
3. Connect to a real Substrate node (local or remote)
4. Run the compiled binary with appropriate commands

The full implementation will provide real blockchain connectivity and cryptographic functions that the simulation currently mimics.
